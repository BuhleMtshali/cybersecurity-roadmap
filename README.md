# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Roadmap & Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity + Security Data Engineering Journey** 🚀  

This repo is my **cyber quest log** — a place where I level up from:

1.  **IT & Linux basics** 🐧 → 

2. **Networking wizardry** 🌍 

3. **Python automation spells** 🐍 → 

4. **SIEM & SOC battles** 📊 → 

5. **Cloud fortresses** ☁️ 

6. → **Detection Engineering traps** 🚨 → 

7. all the way to the **Final Boss Capstones** 🏆.  


🎯 **Main Quest:** Become a **Security Data Engineer / SOC Engineer**,  

while stacking practical projects and battle scars to prove the journey.   


## ⚡ Expect:  

- Hands-on mini projects  

- Tools, scripts, and playbooks  

- Labs & challenges  

- A growing arsenal of cyber skills

## 🧪 Mini-Project Structure

Each folder contains mini-projects with their own **README.md**.  
Format example:

## Project Title (Day X)

## 📌 Overview

- Short description of what the project is about.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Key goals of the project

## ⚙️ Steps Taken

- Commands, configs, or code used.

## 📸 Output

- Screenshots or terminal results.

## 📝 Lessons Learned

- What I discovered and how it connects to the bigger roadmap.

## 🎓 Why This Repo?

- 🛠️ **Proof of Work** – every project shows hands-on practice, not just theory.  

- 🧩 **Modular** – each folder is a mini learning block.  

- 🚀 **Progressive** – builds step by step toward SOC & Security Data Engineering roles.  

---

## 📢 Notes

- This repo is for **educational purposes only**.  

- Some projects simulate attacks or security techniques; these are done in **safe, legal environments** (labs, VMs, CTFs). 

- 🚫 Never attempt these techniques on networks/systems without permission.
