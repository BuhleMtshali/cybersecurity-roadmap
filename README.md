# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Roadmap & Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity + Security Data Engineering Journey** 🚀  
This repo documents my hands-on projects and learning path as I move from **IT & Linux basics** → **Networking** → **Python automation** → **SIEM & SOC labs** → **Cloud Security** → **Detection Engineering** → **Final Capstones**.  

My goal: to become a **Security Data Engineer / SOC Engineer**, building strong foundations while showcasing practical projects along the way.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is organized into phases that follow my roadmap:

``` 

│── 📖 README.md              <- You're here
│
├── 🐧 linux-basics/          <- Permissions, filesystem, scripting
│
├── 🌍 networking/            <- DNS, ARP, Wireshark, ss, ifconfig labs
│
├── 🐍 python-mini-projects/  <- CLI tools, log parsers, automation
│
├── 📊 siem-projects/         <- Log analysis, Splunk/ELK, threat hunting
│
├── 🚨 detection-engineering/ <- Writing rules, alerts, pipelines
│
└── 🏆 final-capstones/       <- End-to-end SOC & cloud security projects

## 🧪 Mini-Project Structure

Each folder contains mini-projects with their own **README.md**.  
Format example:

## Project Title (Day X)

## 📌 Overview

- Short description of what the project is about.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Key goals of the project

## ⚙️ Steps Taken

- Commands, configs, or code used.

## 📸 Output

- Screenshots or terminal results.

## 📝 Lessons Learned

- What I discovered and how it connects to the bigger roadmap.

## 🎓 Why This Repo?

- 🛠️ **Proof of Work** – every project shows hands-on practice, not just theory.  

- 🧩 **Modular** – each folder is a mini learning block.  

- 🚀 **Progressive** – builds step by step toward SOC & Security Data Engineering roles.

## 📢 Notes

- This repo is for **educational purposes only**.  

- Some projects simulate attacks or security techniques; these are done in **safe, legal environments** (labs, VMs, CTFs). 

- 🚫 Never attempt these techniques on networks/systems without permission.
